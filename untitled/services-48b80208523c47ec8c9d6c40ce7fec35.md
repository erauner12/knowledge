## Services

## Overview

networking objects for pods

Uses labels and selectors to identify which workload to expose

K8s itself runs default servicees which allows pods to talk within the cluster

## types of services

### ClusterIP

[Cluster IP](Kubernetes%20and%20Docker%20-%20The%20Container%20Masterclass%20c0d50b427db0483ba561d344502dbb1e/Cluster%20IP%20a224ecb94822476f9f70a16ad77baa69.md)

* Only exposes the service within the cluster
* ClusterIP : Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType .

### NodePort

[NodePort](Kubernetes%20and%20Docker%20-%20The%20Container%20Masterclass%20c0d50b427db0483ba561d344502dbb1e/NodePort%2035e17e3aebe04e4d89e8f5badd97bc14.md)

* Will also create a cluster IP
* NodePort : Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port \(the NodePort \).

### LoadBalancer

* provides external access and IPs for that

### ExternalNAme

* DNS within kubernetes
